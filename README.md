There is a simple way to install all the dependencies/libraries for this project. There is a txt file called requirements.txt
You can use the command shown in the picture above – “pip3 install -r requirements.txt”. This will install all the requirements that are needed to run 
this flask server.

After the dependencies/libraries are installed, use the following command to run the flask server: “python3 main.py”
