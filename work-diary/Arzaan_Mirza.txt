Work Diary:

Week 1:

- The team discussed and decided on the general technologies that we are going to do after going through the strengths of each team member
- and what they are comfortable with in respects to the frontend and backend. We decided a general plan on when we should complete things so that
- we have time at the end of the project to improve existing functionality. We discussed the proposal and how much we should plan to write and what each team 
- member can specifically focus on.
